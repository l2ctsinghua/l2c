# L2C Project

---

Version 0.8

## Introduction

The goal of L2C project is to build a compiler to implement formally certified tranlation from a **Lustre**-like synchronous data-flow language which totally covers **Lustre V6** to **Clight**.
This open source version of L2C has completed the certified translation from a mono-clocked Lustre-like language to Clight. Next we will open the nested-clocked version.



> ####Nouns Explaination
>> #####Lustre
Lustre is a formally defined, declarative, and synchronous dataflow programming language, for programming reactive systems. see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lustre_(programming_language)
>> #####Lustre V6
Lustre V6 is a stable and popular version of Lustre programming language. see http://www-verimag.imag.fr/DIST-TOOLS/SYNCHRONE/lustre-v6/
>> #####Clight
Clight is a large subset of C programming language used in CompCert which is an existing formally certified compiler from Clight to assembly. see http://compcert.inria.fr

> ####Framework
>> The framework of L2C is shown below. This open source version complete the formally certified translation from Well-typed Lustre* AST to Clight as the red box covers.<br/><br/>
